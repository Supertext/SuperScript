####SuperScript offers a means of declaring assets in one part of a .NET web solution and have them emitted somewhere else.


When developing web solutions, assets such as JavaScript declarations or HTML templates are frequently written in a location that differs from their desired output location.

For example, all JavaScript declarations should ideally be emitted together just before the HTML document is closed. And if caching is preferred then these declarations should be in an external file with caching headers set.

This is the functionality offered by SuperScript.
